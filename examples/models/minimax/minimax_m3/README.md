# MiniMax-M3 Examples

This directory contains real-checkpoint conversion and inference examples for
[MiniMax-M3](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3). The bridge imports
the language backbone from the multimodal checkpoint; the vision tower,
projector, lightning-indexer weights, and MTP modules are not converted.

## Hardware requirements

MiniMax-M3 has about 428B parameters stored in bf16 (the published checkpoint
is about 869 GB). The supplied Slurm jobs use 32 GPUs with `TP=1`, `PP=1`, and
`EP=32`, which is a conservative layout for 80 GB GPUs. Hardware with larger
GPU memory can reduce `EP` and the node count as long as `EP` divides 128.

## Setup

Set the container and mounts without placing credentials in the scripts:

```bash
export CONTAINER_IMAGE=/path/to/megatron-bridge.sqsh
export CONTAINER_MOUNTS=/shared:/shared,/path/to/Megatron-Bridge:/opt/Megatron-Bridge
export HF_HOME=/shared/cache/huggingface
export UV_CACHE_DIR=/shared/cache/uv
export HF_TOKEN=your_token_if_required
export SLURM_ACCOUNT=your_slurm_account
```

The repository is mounted at `/opt/Megatron-Bridge` by default. Override
`WORKDIR` if your mount uses a different path. Fully populate the shared model
cache before starting either 45-minute compute job; the checkpoint download is
about 869 GB:

```bash
hf download MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3
```

## Conversion round-trip

Submit [slurm_conversion.sh](slurm_conversion.sh) to import the real HF
checkpoint into a distributed Megatron model and export every bridged tensor
back in memory. The job compares those tensors with the original checkpoint
and skips writing a second 869 GB copy.

```bash
mkdir -p logs
sbatch --account="${SLURM_ACCOUNT}" examples/models/minimax/minimax_m3/slurm_conversion.sh
```

Success is reported only when all bridged language-model parameters match the
original checkpoint exactly (`atol=0`, `rtol=0`). This is an in-memory
verification; standalone Hugging Face checkpoint export is not supported
because the bridge intentionally omits the multimodal modules.

## Inference

Submit [slurm_inference.sh](slurm_inference.sh) to convert the real checkpoint,
apply the checkpoint's chat template with thinking disabled, and greedily
generate a short response with Megatron-Core:

```bash
mkdir -p logs
sbatch --account="${SLURM_ACCOUNT}" examples/models/minimax/minimax_m3/slurm_inference.sh
```

The run is successful when it completes without missing-weight or forward
errors and the generated answer is coherent for the prompt.

## Validated configuration

The real `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` checkpoint was validated on 32 H100 80 GB
GPUs with `TP=1`, `PP=1`, `EP=32`, and `ETP=1`. All 1,053 mapped parameter
tasks passed the exact in-memory HF → Megatron → HF round-trip check. With the chat
template enabled, Megatron generated a coherent continuation beginning:
